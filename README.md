# Main-Java
This program will prompt the user for an employee number and hours worked in a week.  Then the program will compute the gross pay for the employee based on a $8.25 an hour pay scale.  Once the gross is computed, the program will compute the cost of deductions.  Deduction percentage will be based on amount of the gross pay.
